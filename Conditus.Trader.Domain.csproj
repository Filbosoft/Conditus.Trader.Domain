    <Description>
      This nuget package includes the models produced by the various microservices.
      It is to be implemented in each of the micro services to ensure it's using the correct model,
      and to avoid having to update models in all our services if one changes,
      it should as simple as updating this nuget package, and potentially using a new version namespace.
